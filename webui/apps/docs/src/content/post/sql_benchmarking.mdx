## SQL Benchmarking: What is it, and how does it work?

test cases and expected queries
gpt3.5 performs at 8%

but wait, that is very ridged, what about equivalent queries?
we can also compare the data coming back from these queries. It is not perfect, since two queries can be functionally
different  but happen to return the same data (consider two radically different queries, both of which do not match any records)

now we are up to 70% performance

we can go a step further here though. even if we are comparing the actual data, we can end up with columns in a different order. 
Let's use an llm to determine if two queries + a sample of data are equivalent:

now we are at 90% performance.
